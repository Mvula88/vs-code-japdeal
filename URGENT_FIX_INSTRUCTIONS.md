# URGENT: Fix User Registration Issue

## The Problem
User registration is failing because the database trigger that creates profile records is not working in your Supabase instance.

## Immediate Fix - Run This SQL in Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**: 
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ugctohwrmliejdbrkter/sql/new

2. **Copy and paste the ENTIRE contents** of `complete-fix-user-trigger.sql`

3. **Click "Run"** at the bottom right

4. You should see a success message: "SUCCESS: Trigger and function created successfully!"

## What This Fix Does

1. Creates the missing trigger on `auth.users` table
2. Creates a function that automatically creates profile records
3. Adds a fallback function for manual profile creation
4. Updates the sign-up page to handle errors gracefully

## Testing the Fix

After running the SQL:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/sign-up
2. Create a test account
3. Check the Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to **Authentication** → **Users** (should show the new user)
   - Go to **Table Editor** → **profiles** (should show a matching profile)

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Run this test in the SQL editor to verify:

```sql
-- Test if the trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created';

-- Test if the function exists  
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'handle_new_user';

-- Check if profiles table has correct permissions
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_name='profiles';
```

## Alternative Solution

If the trigger still doesn't work, the updated sign-up page now has a fallback that will manually create the profile. This ensures users can still register even if the trigger fails.

## Why This Happened

Your Supabase project was created but the database migrations weren't fully applied. Specifically:
- The `profiles` table was created ✅
- But the trigger to populate it was not created ❌

This fix creates the missing trigger and adds error handling to prevent future issues.
